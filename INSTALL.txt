Installation is easy: copy all the files into a password-protected
directory on a webserver with PHP installed.

Do not forget the password protection, as getfile.php is essentially
a remote file disclosure backdoor. It will be removed entirely at some
point in the future, but for now it is still needed.

Place your target file in the root and replace proj0000.exe with it.

Opening the index.html file will for now start and disassemble proj0000.exe
but this will be turned into a "real" file open dialog soon enough. I'm
just too lazy to click every time I press F5.
